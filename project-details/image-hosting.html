        <h1>Image-Hosting App</h1>
        <p>
          This website was created as a way to upload images to a website. Some
          of the features of the App was to create an account, upload images,
          view images, and comment on photos. Upon entering the website, a user
          was prompted to login or register an account which required username,
          email, and a password. After registering an account the user was taken
          to the home page where they could see all their images in little cards
          style format. Clicking on an image would take you to a new page with
          that image enlarged, along with the details they provided when
          uploading and comments made by other users.

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- TODO Fix This -->
          Ensuring persistence data among the different users such as after
          logging in the correct data being displayed. This project was my first
          introduction with javascript, SQL, handlebars and Node.js. Ensuring
          that all of these tools worked together seamlessly from a users
          standpoint was challenging.
